# Personal Portfolio CI/CD Pipeline

A professional portfolio website with automated deployment infrastructure using AWS DevOps services.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a complete CI/CD pipeline for a static website using AWS cloud services. The pipeline automatically builds and deploys changes from the source repository.

## Architecture

- **Source Control**: GitHub repository
- **Build Process**: AWS CodeBuild with custom buildspec
- **Deployment**: Amazon S3 static website hosting  
- **Automation**: AWS CodePipeline for end-to-end workflow

## Technologies

- HTML5/CSS3 for frontend
- AWS CodePipeline for orchestration
- AWS CodeBuild for build automation
- Amazon S3 for hosting and storage
- GitHub for version control

## Features

- Responsive design for all devices
- Automated deployment on code changes
- Professional styling without frameworks
- Cost-effective using AWS Free Tier services
- Production-ready configuration

## Deployment Process

1. Code changes pushed to GitHub repository
2. CodePipeline detects changes automatically
3. CodeBuild processes and optimizes files
4. Automated deployment to S3 static hosting
5. Website updates reflect immediately

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html in browser
3. Make changes and test locally
4. Commit and push to trigger pipeline
